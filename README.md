# Adidas Sales Dashboard
Welcome to the Adidas Sales Dashboard project! This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data sourced from an open data portal, focusing on Adidas product sales. The project involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python's Plotly, Dash, and Streamlit libraries to create interactive charts and enhance user understanding.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to present Adidas sales data in a user-friendly and interactive dashboard format. The dashboard allows users to explore various aspects of sales data through interactive charts such as bar charts, pie charts, and line charts. Additionally, users can refine their data view using five interactive filters:
- Date Range Picker: Users can select a start and end date using a calendar format.
- Region Picker: Users can choose a specific region from a dropdown list.
- City Picker: Users can select a city from a dropdown list.
- State Picker: Users can select a state from a dropdown list.

Once users apply their desired filters, the dashboard updates to display relevant charts based on the filtered data. The dataset used in this project spans from January 2020 to December 2021.
